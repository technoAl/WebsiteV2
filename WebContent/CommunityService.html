        <h1> Noctem Development </h1>
        <p>I helped found a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting computer science education through competitions & other educational events. This year
        we hosted 2 competitions. In December of 2019, we held an in-person competition in Acton, MA involving over 50 participants for a coding competition and during quarantine
        we held an international online competition with over 250 participants. I learned a lot through this experience like how to write CS competition problems, manage and advertise
        a competition, and many other important skill(like how the government works). Here is a link to our website <a src="Noctem.dev"> Noctem</a></p>

        <h1> Seven Hills Volunteering </h1>
        <p> During quarantine I helped volunteer at seven hills by playing board games with many participants in the programs there. One member really enjoyed online games
        so we played games like fantasy forge and yu-gi-oh duel links together. I spent much time entertaining and interacting with these people during a time when that was nearly impossible
        , and was definitely an invaluable experience.</p>
