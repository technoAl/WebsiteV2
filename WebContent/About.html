      <p>  Hi, I’m Alex. I started attending Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science this year.
        I have greatly enjoyed my time at the academy so far.
        I used to attend Acton Boxborough Regional High School, which was a school that I enjoyed my time at, but one that I was ready to move on from.
         My interests are competitive programming and math, which I love to spend time on inside and outside of school. My hobbies include playing video games and building and flying drones.</p>

      <p>Back at Acton-Boxborough, I was a member of the Science Olympiad team, and a developer for Idealab, AB’s computer science club. For Science Olympiad I focused all my effort into engineering or build events. My freshmen year I designed balsa wood towers and flew model helicopters. Many revisions went into each design before we would bring them to the competition, and I loved collaborating with my partners. My sophomore year I continued with similar events and chose to do Mission Possible and Wright Stuff. For wright stuff, our team had to build indoor free flight planes that would fly as long as possible. My partner and I were able to make one fly for 2+ minutes during that season. Furthermore, I did mission possible which was an event that required the creation of a rube Goldberg machine around different energy transfers. Each transfer was worth a certain amount of points. For this event, I spent 300+ hours soldering and now I love doing it. I learned electronics and circuitry,as well in order to complete the certain tasks. </p>

      <p> Additionally, I helped lead Idealab to its most populous year ever among the student body. As a leader, I helped gather study material for the ACSL competition, and our team even managed to make it into the top ten for senior division.
        It was a great learning experience not only learning about the topics but helping people with problems that they had.
        I will definitely miss these clubs that have taught me so much during my two short years at Acton Boxborough High School, and I will never forget them, but it's time to expand my horizons and push myself to learn even more.

      <p>  Programming has been my life blood for a very long time. I love building tools that can help people, and learning about algorithms that are used to solve interesting real-life scenarios.
        I compete in USACO or the USA Computing Olympiad and have had a lot of fun doing so. I highly recommend the competition to anyone who is interested in math and computer science. However, I also love going to hackathons and making projects that are anywhere from amusing to useful.
        I usually do not have a lot of time to work incrementally on a project, so I go to hackathons. They are competitions that last from 12 to 24 hours and offer an opportunity to code and make a project from start to finish during the compeition. You can also win awards for your work. I love attending these, and have attended HackExeter, HackDartmouth, MIT Blueprint, and Metrohacks in 2019. All my code is available on Github, and some project submissions were submitted to devpost. Both can be found here:

      <p>Ktbyte is a computer science academy that focuses on teaching middle school and high school students CS outside of school.  I originally started as a student, and as a I gained more knowledge, I was promoted to a teaching assistant position and eventually a small instructor. I became an instructor when my friend and I proposed the starting of a robotics section/club with the academy.
        We wanted to teach younger students how to use Arduino. Eventually all the students would get the opportunity to compete in competitions like the young inventor’s program or NICEE. It was a great experience teaching material because I had to make the content understandable for kids significantly younger then I was. I had trouble explaining things in a simple way for elementary students to understand at first and I developed so many skills teaching these classes.
        I no longer teach any of the in-person courses as I have begun helping with the new online courses that will be launching later this year. Here is a link to all of the Ktbyte classes if you are interested:
