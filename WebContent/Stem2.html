        STEM2 is not really a continuation of STEM, but it is a course designed to benefit the community through client requested projects. Organizations like Seven Hills and Eastern
        Seals will request assistive devices, and us the students will do work to solve their problems in need. We spend all of D-Term planning, prototyping and eventually presenting our projects to our clients.

        Problem:
      </h1>
      <p>
        Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) and limited mobility may have difficulty holding paintbrushes/creating art through traditional means
        current mouth painting solutions are tiring and uncontrollable.

        Approach:
      </h1>
      <p>
        Our goal is to engineer a mouth-based assistive device to ease mouth painting that relieves weight, increases control, allows individuals to express themselves creatively. Our group decided
        to approach this goal from a mouth painting standpoint as our client had requested so. We created a mouth mounted device that holds the paintbrush and provides with more control and comfort
        than painting with your mouth normally. It utilizes a 3D printed piece with a foam compression layer. The mouth is velcro strapped so it makes contact with the users cheeks. There is a hole
        where the foam is added which holds the paintbrush. The paintbrush still goes into the user's mouth but the added device holds it in place while painting so a lot of the stress does not
        go directly onto the user's mouth. Below are two images of the device. There is one image of the CAD and one of the prototype.

        The piece shown above is the final mouthpiece prototype. Many elements are still there from the first prototype, but many have been altered. The slope of the mouthpiece has been increased drastically for comfort, and the strap hooks have changed as well.

        This foam compression piece is the other half of the final prototype. It is sleek and consistent in its function, and through the testing that occured through out design studies, proved to be the best combination.
